# residual-neural-net
TensorFlow implementation of a residual neural network (ResNet).

The implementation is mostly based on the 'Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition' paper by He et al.

After training over 100 epochs, with a batch size of 128, the accuracy achieved on the CIFAR-10 test set is 86.53%
